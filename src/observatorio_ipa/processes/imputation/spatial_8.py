"""
Functions to impute TAC values using values from spatial neighboring pixels and DEM data.


functions in this module use a default scale of 463.31271652791656, projected on 'SR-ORG:6974'
Which is consistent what is being used for Modis Terra and Aqua images

This is based on the js code from - users/observatorionieves/modules/CR/Spatial_8.js

GLOSSARY
TAC: Terra-Aqua Classification?
QA_CR: Quality Assessment - C? R?
DEM: Digital Elevation Model

The following conventions are used:
- All server side variables are prefixed with 'ee_'
- Image, ImageCollection and FeatureCollections are sufficed with '_img', '_ic' and '_fc' when possible

    Imputes missing TAC values using DEM and TAC data fro spatial neighboring pixels.

    Imputes values for points where TAC==0 (nodata) using DEM and TAC information of spatial adjacent
    pixels and a kernel of neighboring pixels. Uses a 3x3 kernel selecting the 8 surrounding pixels
    to impute the TAC values.

    QA_CR values are updated to QA_CR=50 for new imputed TAC values >0, otherwise retains the original QA_CR value.

    these bands see module binary.py documentation

    The function uses elevation data to impute values for the "TAC" band where TAC == 0 (nodata)
     by using the elevation information of neighboring pixels. The elevation data is also used
     to infer the minimum height of snow pixels and to compare cloud height data with the minimum
     snow height data to potentially reclassify cloud pixels as snow.
